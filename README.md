<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Kabir aka asparkoffire</h1>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Terraform**

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **Kubernetes, AWS**

I am a highly enthusiastic and super skillful fresher DevOps Engineer with almost an year of experience in designing, building, and maintaining scalable and reliable infrastructure. With a passion for automation, I have developed expertise in designing and implementing automated CI/CD pipelines, deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, and monitoring and optimizing application performance.

Apart from DevOps I have interest in IoT, AI, Machine learning and Game Development. In my free time, I like to play video games or learn about various new technology that might be "the-next-big-thing".

I am eager to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and dedication to a dynamic and innovative company that values creativity, collaboration, and continuous learning.
